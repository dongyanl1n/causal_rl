## Usage

To run the experiment, follow command examples in `submit.sh` that uses `main.py`.

`bayes_net`, `envs`, and `models` contain modules used in main.py.

`plot_reward.py`, `template_matching.py`, and `graph_recorvery.py` are ad hoc scripts I used to analyze/visualize results; feel free to ignore and write your own.
